# Action Amplifier (ActionAmp)

An Astro.js-based productivity application designed to help you focus on the most important and valuable tasks.

## Overview

Action Amplifier helps you organize your thinking about work and actions, following GTD (Getting Things Done) principles.

## Key Features

- **Inbox**: A flexible text input where you can capture anything - URLs, notes, ideas, tasks
- **Item Types**: Inbox items can be Actions, Resources, or Notes
- **Triage System**: Process inbox items and assign them to appropriate destinations
- **Quick Actions**: Complete simple tasks immediately during triage
- **Areas/Contexts**: Organize work into life areas (e.g., Home, Work, Personal)
- **Projects**: Group related actions and resources within areas for focused execution
- **Next Action**: Context-aware view that automatically presents the most important next action
- **Reviews**: Daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly reviews that collect completed items and use customizable templates
- **Archiving**: Projects, contexts, actions, and resources can be archived when no longer active
- **Text-Based Storage**: All data stored in text files for portability and simplicity

## Workflow

1. **Capture**: Add items to the Inbox
2. **Triage**: Process each item - classify as Action, Resource, or Note, then complete immediately or assign to a project
3. **Organize**: Projects belong to Areas (Home, Work, Personal, etc.) and contain both actions and resources
4. **Execute**: View Next Action - the system determines which action from which project to work on based on your current context
5. **Review**: Create periodic reviews (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly) that automatically gather completed items and provide space for reflection

## Core Principles

- Focus on what matters most
- GTD methodology
- Text file-based data storage
- Simple, friction-free capture and processing
